# Baypaw

Baypaw is a replacement to our old *shitty* IPC implementation

It can be used by other things on Fates List for more efficient data retrieval

The code is highly insecure to remote attacks and should not be run without a firewall on port 1234

*Like all of our rust code, this requires nightly rust in order to compile**
